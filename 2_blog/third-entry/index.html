      <h1>DAY 3</h1>
      <p>There was a weird task, and to tell you the truth I wouldn't have done so fast if my husband wouldn't have noticed my mistake. It turned out that I confused some important word, say, I wrote colur instead of color, and, as the system didn't understand what to do with the styling. The task was to insert the link just on the bottom of the pic and it was about absolute and relative links, and to to it for the first time was quite difficult for me.
        Now it's ok, anyway.</p>        
       <p>And! Now, looking back there is one experience I'd like to share with you. If I had done the exercise on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> recommended by <a href="https://code.makery.ch/">Code Makery</a>, my mistake would have been spotted by the platform at once. Atom, which was in the list of recommended platforms for coders at <a href="https://learn.udacity.com/"> Udacity</a>, didn't provide users with such a possibility, at least, its free version.
        So, if you are learning to code, use this platform, it's pretty awesome.</p>
