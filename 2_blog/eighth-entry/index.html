      <h1>DAY 8</h1>
    <p>The day before the deadline was the most difficult, ahaha.</p>
    <p>The content for blog was written, but there were not any entries in the Blog page, and there was some information in the tutorial that I didn't learn. Well, it was  done ok.  I was lucky to have a mentor, who at once noticed my mistakes.</p>
    <p>Every 30 minutes I deployed the site to the life server, so it was easy to check which pages work and which don't.</p>
    <p>Probably the most difficult part was Navigation with Bootstrap, so I advise to read it carefully. Then just follow the instructions and you will manage it 100%.</p>
    <p>However, there was a problem which a beginner wouldn't solve - the code which I had just inserted to the site and which was on the tutorial page didn't work.</p>
  <p>It turned out that it was a bit probably outdated, as once we opened the link above the code and inserted just the similar, everything was ok. The only thing I had done was just the titles' change.</p>
  <div class="photocontainer">
    <img src="/img/bootstrap.jpg" height="350px" alt="Bootstrap">
  </div>
  <p>And that's how the updated code looks like:</p>
