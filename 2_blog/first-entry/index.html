      <h1>This is the First Entry</h1>
      <h2>DAY 1</h2>
    <p>There was the list of free sources in the offer to start learning HTML and CSS, so I got registered to <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> and started an HTML course.</p>
    <p>I have never been a programmer, though I was working on the online project for 9 years. Sure, there were lots of things which were not that new to me - I know quite a lot about tags and all this stuff that always remains behind the screen. I also know a lot about the colours combinations and colours pallets, as I am familiar with Adobe Photoshop creative tools.</p>
    <p>Moreover, my husband and his twin brother are IT specialists. They do lots of things together not only for work but also for fun and because they just can. I am proud of them both as they do even 3D games, just <a href="http://gameboat.net/"> just have a look.</a></p>
    <p>So all these terms like CSS,  an absolute / a relative link, you-forget-to-close-the-tag and many other others are in my head.</p>
    <p>Sure, Udacity helped me a lot to systematize my knowledge so I wrote my first code.</p>
    <p>And I was really happy when I managed to code a button. The same day I learned how to see the results of my work on a webpage.</p>
      <div class="photocontainer">
          <img src="/img/button-dont-touch.jpg" alt="button prg" height="auto" width="80%">
      </div>
    <p>Udacity suggested coders would use ATOM platform, so I installed the platform and under their guidance I systematized my folder on the laptop with their platform. Now, every time I add a file to the folder <span style="font-style: italic;">code_it</span> I can see it on Atom as well. Quite a miracle in a way, don't you think?</p>
