      <h1>DAY 6</h1>
      <p>So, I started doing the site.</p>
      <p>The first task - to download Visual Studio Code was pretty easy for me - I have worked at lots of Editors Wordpress platforms and, besides, I have already got used to work at Atom, so I was just wondering that the Platform knows all the words programmers use, it opens and closes tags and “ signs and all that.</p>
      <p>Naturally I synchronized my files with html and scc first examples I saved from Udacity, and every time I need to find some basic information, I can refer to this initial files</p>
      <p>Then there was information about the importance of always putting < !DOCTYPE html> on the first line in the file named index.html to let the browser know the type of the document. I created the file and did as I was told, here is the screenshot of my first site first document:</p>
      <p>It's not it latest version of course, but with the assistance of my husband and the initial knowledge got at Udacity courses I managed to do it quite smart (I truly hope so at least).</p>
      <p>To round the photo I used a smart tool I spotted somehow earlier, here it is <a href="https://www.cssmatic.com/border-radius">Border Radius CSS Generator.</a> There are some other options, and what's important - all you have to do is to copy a code to your css page and change the value.</p>
      <div class="photocontainer">
        <img src="/img/code-shadows-decor.jpeg" alt="CSS style maker" height="400px" width="auto">
      </div>
      <p>There is another good source I spotted while googling some information about how to add style to the page. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/playdemo.asp?filename=playcss_text-decoration-style">W3Schools CSS font maker</a>.</p>
      <p>On top of the page you will find the numerous values of the most useful (and rare ones too!) properties. Just change the values when necessary, and there your page is, styled and furnished as <span style="text-decoration: line-through">a new year tree</span> as if it was done by a advanced programmer with a good taste. </p>
      <div class="photocontainer">
        <img src="/img/decorations.jpg" alt="CSS style maker" height="200px" width="auto">
      </div>
      <p>And, of course there is another useful thing for all, even the senior code css writers, at least for those who (just for the time being) cannot allow to hire a designer to make a visual picture of the site. </p>
      <p>As an advanced photographer and quite a professional clothing style expert I can tell you that if you use more than one color on your website and in order to achieve a good color combination you will need a <span style="font-style: italic;">Colour Wheel</span>.</p>
      <p>The fact of the matter is that you will never 100% know how to create a well-balanced color combination without it, at least as precisely as modern program that incorporated there, does. </p>
      <p>While creating pages, I decided to add a matching color to is, and I would have never know which of the shades will suit the best without it. </p>
      <p>There was a link to it in the PowerCoders tutorial, and I used to used it before as well.</p>
      <p>Just try it yourself Color wheel, a color palette generator by <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel">Adobe</a></p>
      <div class="photocontainer">
        <img src="/img/color-wheel.jpg" alt="Color wheel" height="400px" width="auto">
    </div>
      <p>First set a mode you would like to achieve there:</p>
      <div class="photocontainer">
        <img src="/img/adobe-color-pallette-1.jpg" alt="Adobe colors" height="400px" width="auto">
    </div>
      <p>You can move the circles, the other ones  will move according to the mode youàve set</p>
      <p>Here you can delete the numbers and set your basic:</p>
      <div class="photocontainer">
        <img src="/img/set-the-basic-color.jpg" alt="Basic color set" height="300px" width="auto">
    </div>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
      <p>And past the code into your main.css file, like here:</p>
      <div class="photocontainer">
          <img src="/img/main-scc-screenshot.jpg" alt="Basic color" height="300px" width="auto">
      </div>
