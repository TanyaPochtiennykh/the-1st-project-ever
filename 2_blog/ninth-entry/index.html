      <h1>DAY 9</h1>
      <h1>Instead of the Conclusion</h1>
<p>My first online job included the part I had never did before - publishing a ready article on the web. It was not difficult for me to write an article on a particular topic those days, as well as to find suitable illustrations for it (by the way you can get free photos on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>, just don't forget to mention the author of beneath the pic), but it was a big problem for me to publish it or rather to prepare an article to publication. All these titles, subtitles, headers 1 and headers 2, as well as alts and codes I had to insert were pretty new to me, and I was kind of panicking at the beginning. Then my husband helped me, and here I again thank him for his patience and his compassion. He showed me all the tricks of inserting the photos and lost of keyboard combinations and all these thing a standard Wordpress editor has, and now it is so familiar to me that I can do it just automatically.</p>
<p>Hope same will be with coding one day.</p>
<p>Hope I will be getting surer of myself and of what I am doing when I am creating complicated and nice programs.</p>
<p>Hope my online pages will look smarter and more stylish day after day.</p>
<p>And I do believe that I will manage it.</p>
