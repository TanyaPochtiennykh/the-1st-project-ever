      <h1>This is the Blog</h1>
      <h2><span style="color:#E66245">Hi, nice to see you there:)</span></h2>
      <p>Well, I didn't start writing the blog the day I spotted the ad and applied but I do remember that day very well, and how inspired I was.</p> 
      <p>I, ex-Editor in Chief and English Teacher, couldn't help looking and dreaming of becoming a programmer one day and somehow I felt that this ad is what I've dreamt of for quite a long time! In my native country I was in the comfort zone and â€¦not that was I was lazy, but a new activity would have meant I had less time on my work, and, therefore, less money in my pocket, so I just went on doing what I was quite good at.</p>
      <p>Now, when my small but cosy business died, I do understand that I must do something I have long dreamt of.</p>
      <p>Well, to cut a long story short, I was excited by the opportunity to learn coding. I have always loved maths and long ago I was good at it, so, the time has come.</p>
      <p>I read the ad and the instructions once more and on the same day late at night I applied.</p>
