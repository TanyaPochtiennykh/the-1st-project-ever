      <h1>DAY 5</h1>
      <p>The next day I did folders where the information about every page of the site shall be stored. I just copied the initial files to the newly created folders named after the site pages names. It was pretty easy. The only thing is that turned out to be impossible to rename the copied folder with a double-click on its name on Visual Studio Code platform. You can try, but if you also don’t succeed in doing so, just click on the folder with your right button of the mouse, and it will be possible to rename it. </p>
      <h2 style="color:#E66245">ADVICE</h2>
      <p>It was not THE problem, but well… kind of a problem. When I started building the site, I moved the whole folder with the examples I copied while doing Udacity tasks to my Visual Studio Code cabinet, and just made another folder with a new name.</p>
      <p>Then it turned out that there are difficulties with the files' order and that the system sometimes just didn't know what file to show up. Besides, I named the files and folders not after the names on the tutorial. And you know, it was a bad idea for a beginner like me. So, I created the folder for the examples I stored before, moved out from the floder with files to this site and after that renamed all the folders and files as it was suggested in the PowerCoders tutorial. It allowed me to get the better orientation among all these programmers' words and descriptions when doing my own code.</p>
